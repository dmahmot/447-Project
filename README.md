  ## THE MAP

Followed this tutorial - https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/

- Most of the changes here are inside home.html
- Inside html files, anything inside of <script> tags is where you can use javascript
  
- In the header of base.html, leaflet.css and leaflet.js (map stuff) are included and extended to all html files
- In home.html
  
  - line 5 \<div id="map"> \</div> is where the map should show up on the page
       
  - line 30 and on is the map code
  
  ### Map Functions and Stuff
    - map('map') links to the div (I think) 
    - titleLayer() is what builds the main layer of the map
    - getColor(), style(), highlightFeature(), resetHighlight(), zoomToFeature(), and onEachFeature()
      - these are used for specific features of the map
    - geoJson() is where where we pass a geoJson variable
      - a ***geoJson variable*** contains data for the outline of each state county, as well as our data we want to pass to the map
      - this is the giant statesData countiesData variables
    - control() creates a "control" variable, ours is called ***info***
      - all the code below control() is for the live pop up stuff you get when you hover over something
